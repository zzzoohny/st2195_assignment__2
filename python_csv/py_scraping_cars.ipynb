CSV files normally will even survive naive translation from one character set to another (unlike nearly all proprietary data formats).

For example, health databases such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Demographic_and_Health_Survey\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Demographic and Health Survey\">Demographic and Health Survey</a> typically repeat some questions for each child of a given parent (perhaps up to a fixed maximum number of children). <a href=\"/wiki/Statistical_analysis\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Statistical analysis\">Statistical analysis</a> systems often include utilities that can \"rotate\" such data; for example, a \"parent\" record that includes information about five children can be split into five separate records, each containing (a) the information on one child, and (b) a copy of all the non-child-specific information. CSV can represent either the \"vertical\" or \"horizontal\" form of such data.\\n</p><p>In a relational database, similar issues are readily handled by creating a separate relation for each such group, and connecting \"child\" records to the related \"parent\" records using a <a href=\"/wiki/Foreign_key\" title=\"Foreign key\">foreign key</a> (such as an ID number or name for the parent). In markup languages such as XML, such groups are typically enclosed within a parent element and repeated as necessary (for example, multiple <code>&lt;child&gt;</code> nodes within a single <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> node).

Some implementations allow or require single or double quotation marks around some or all fields; and some reserve the first record as a header containing a list of field names. The character set being used is undefined: some applications require a Unicode <a href=\"/wiki/Byte_order_mark\" title=\"Byte order mark\">byte order mark</a> (BOM) to enforce Unicode interpretation (sometimes even a UTF-8 BOM).<sup id=\"cite_ref-rfc4180_1-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-rfc4180-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Files that use the tab character instead of comma can be more precisely referred to as \"TSV\" for tab-separated values.\\n</p><p>Other implementation differences include handling of more commonplace field separators (such as space or semicolon) and newline characters inside text fields. One more subtlety is the interpretation of a blank line: it can equally be the result of writing a record of zero fields, or a record of one field of zero length; thus decoding it is ambiguous.\\n</p>\\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"OKI_frictionless_tabular_data_package\">OKI frictionless tabular data package</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Comma-separated_values&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: OKI frictionless tabular data package\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\\n<p>In 2011 <a href=\"/wiki/Open_Knowledge_Foundation\" title=\"Open Knowledge Foundation\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> (OKF) and various partners created a data protocols working group, which later evolved into the Frictionless Data initiative.

The exceptions are <i>(a)</i> programs may not support line-breaks within quoted fields, <i>(b)</i> programs may confuse the optional header with data or interpret the first data line as an optional header and <i>(c)</i> double quotes in a field may not be parsed correctly automatically.\\n</p>\\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Basic_rules\">Basic rules</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Comma-separated_values&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: Basic rules\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\\n<p>Many informal documents exist that describe \"CSV\" formats.\\n<a href=\"/wiki/IETF\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"IETF\">IETF</a> RFC 4180 (summarized above) defines the format for the \"text/csv\" <a href=\"/wiki/MIME_type\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"MIME type\">MIME type</a> registered with the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority\" title=\"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\">IANA</a>.\\n</p><p>Rules typical of these and other \"CSV\" specifications and implementations are as follows:\\n</p>\\n<div><ul><li>CSV is a <a href=\"/wiki/Delimited\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Delimited\">delimited</a> data format that has <a href=\"/wiki/Field_(computer_science)\" title=\"Field (computer science)\">fields/columns</a> separated by the <a href=\"/wiki/Comma_(punctuation)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Comma (punctuation)\">comma</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Grapheme\" title=\"Grapheme\">character</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Row_(database)\" title=\"Row (database)\">records/rows</a> terminated by newlines.</li><li>A CSV file does not require a specific <a href=\"/wiki/Character_encoding\" title=\"Character encoding\">character encoding</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Byte_order\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Byte order\">byte order</a>, or line terminator format (some software do not support all line-end variations).</li><li>A record ends at a line terminator.

For example, the numeric quantity 65535 may be represented as the 5 ASCII characters \"65535\" (or perhaps other forms such as \"0xFFFF\", \"000065535.000E+00\", etc.); but not as a sequence of 2 bytes intended to be treated as a single binary integer rather than as two characters (e.g. the numbers 11264–11519 have a comma as their high order byte: <code class=\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-perl mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"nb\">ord</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;,&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">256</span><span class=\"o\">..</span><span class=\"nb\">ord</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;,&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">256</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">255</span></code>).
